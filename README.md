# About
An unofficial handbook for tech people and more specifically, UC Davis computer science students, made by The UC Davis Computer Science Club. Feel free to submit a pull request or email/contact the UC Davis Computer Science Club to ask questions or suggest changes. 

# How to Use
1. Download the PDF -- the preview on Github will not allow you to click on links and it might be a little hard to navigate without that function
2. Read the PDF
3. Yay! 

# Pushing
This is for the UC Davis Computer Science Club members who are pushing to the handbook -- please make sure to version bump and cite your name for any changes you made. For example, if Secretary Jill Doe made a change to the FAQ subsection of Classes and Waitlisting, she would put in Version History, if the previous version was 0.1: 

>**Version 0.2:**

>Edited and updated FAQ subsection of Classes and Waitlisting -- Jill Doe, Secretary  

Please follow this format to keep everything consistent and information attributed and accredited to the right people.
